# Project Wisdom Library

Welcome to the **Project Wisdom Library**—a centralized, AI-driven archive for conceptual distillations, investigations, and epistemic history. This repository is designed for **Issue-Driven** autonomous agent operation, moving beyond simple data storage to capture the "Wisdom" and "Paradigm Shifts" of your projects.

## Core Principles
- **Holistic System Thinking:** We analyze connections, not just components.
- **Epistemic History:** We capture *why* decisions were made, not just *what* changed.
- **The Wisdom Ladder:** We systematically climb from Data (Level 1) to Wisdom (Level 4).

## How to Use This Library

### 1. For Vision Owners (Humans)
**Do not browse folders manually.** Use the automated Intake Process.

1.  **Start an Investigation:**
    * Go to the **Issues** tab.
    * Click **New Issue**.
    * Select **[Intake]: Conceptual Investigation**.
    * Fill out the form (Context is critical!).

2.  **Strategic Realignment:**
    * If you see a "Paradigm Shift" backlog item, it means the system has detected a need for cultural or mental model change.

### 2. For AI Agents (System Owners)
**Do not chat.** Execute the mandate.

1.  **Trigger:** Watch for new Issues with the label `investigation`.
2.  **Execution:** Follow the **[Automation Guide](docs/AUTOMATION_GUIDE.md)**.
    * Parse the Issue.
    * Establish the **Wisdom Ladder**.
    * Execute Analysis.
    * Generate Artifacts (Protocol Compliant).
    * Update Catalogue.
3.  **Delivery:** Submit a Pull Request with the results.
