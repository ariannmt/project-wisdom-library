# Atomic Investigations (Levels 1-2)

This folder contains focused, single-subject investigations. These establish the "Ground Truth" (Data) and "Context" (Information) required before higher-level wisdom can be synthesized.

## Scope
- **Level 1 (Data):** Hard Architecture Mapping.
- **Level 2 (Context):** Decision Forensics, Anti-Library Extraction.

## Instructions
- **Template:** Use `/templates/ATOMIC_ANALYSIS_TEMPLATE.md`
- **Naming:** `YYYY-MM-DD-short-descriptor.md`
- **Constraint:** Do not attempt philosophical synthesis here; focus on the facts.
