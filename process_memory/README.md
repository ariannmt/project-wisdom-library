# Process Memory & Epistemic History (Level 3)

This folder stores the **Epistemic History** of the project—the evolution of thought, the "Roads Not Taken," and the subjective rationale behind decisions.

## Instructions
- **Template:** Use `/templates/PROCESS_MEMORY_TEMPLATE.md`
- **Protocol:** Every file MUST conclude with a strictly validated **JSON Protocol Block** for the System Owner agent.
- **Content:** Focus on *why* we decided (or decided NOT) to do something.
