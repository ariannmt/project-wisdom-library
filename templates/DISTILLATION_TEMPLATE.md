# Conceptual Distillation: [Theme/Project Name]

**Type:** Long-Form Distillation
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Sources:** [Repositories/Docs Analyzed]

---

## 1. The Concrete Reality (Hard Mapping)
[Summary of the physical/technical structure observed. What effectively exists now?]

## 2. The Epistemic History (Context & Decisions)
[Summary of how the system evolved to this state. Derived from Decision Forensics. Why is it this way?]

## 3. The Anti-Library (Negative Knowledge)
[Summary of failed experiments, discarded paths, and what we learned NOT to do.]

---

## 4. Abstraction & Wisdom (The Conceptual Layer)

### A. Core Mental Models
*Concepts that guide reasoning in this system.*
> **"[Model Name]"**
> *Definition:* [One-liner definition]
> *Application:* [How this concept manifests in the code, architecture, or team behavior]

### B. System Archetypes
*Recurring structural motifs or systemic behaviors (e.g. "Shifting the Burden", "Tragedy of the Commons").*
- **Archetype Identified:** [e.g., "Drifting Goals"]
- **Manifestation:** [How this specific pattern plays out in the project currently]
- **Leverage Point:** [Where can we intervene to change the system dynamic?]

### C. Paradigm Shift
*The fundamental change in worldview required to understand this system.*
- **From (Old Paradigm):** [e.g., "Security as a Perimeter"]
- **To (New Paradigm):** [e.g., "Zero Trust Identity"]

### D. Root Metaphor
*The single unifying image or analogy of the system.*
> [e.g., "The Repository as a Biological Cell" or "The Database as a River"]

## 5. Ripple Effects & Forward Vision
[Consequences of these abstractions on future strategy. Given these paradigms, what must happen next?]

## 6. Linked Artifacts
[Cross-links to Process Memory, Atomic Analyses, and relevant Backlog items]
